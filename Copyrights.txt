# Social Media Project - Personal Statement

## Purpose
This social media project was developed as a personal learning exercise to enhance my skills in PHP and web development,
and im going to explain every code with a small comment so it wont be confusing.

## Motivation
As a self-taught developer, I believe that the best way to learn is by doing. This project allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context, solving real-world problems and overcoming challenges along the way. By building this project independently, I aimed to:

1. **Deepen My Understanding of PHP:** By writing all the backend code myself, I gained a deeper understanding of PHP syntax, functions, and best practices.
2. **Improve Problem-Solving Skills:** Tackling various issues such as user authentication, session and cookies management, and data validation helped me become a better problem solver.
3. **Learn Database Management:** Designing and interacting with a MySQL database provided hands-on experience with SQL queries and database design.
4. **Enhance Front-End Skills:** Integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with PHP to create a seamless user experience improved my front-end development skills.
5. **Prepare for Future Projects:** This project serves as a foundation for more complex web applications I plan to develop in the future.

## Licensing
This project is shared publicly on GitHub for educational purposes. Feel free to explore, learn from, and adapt the code for your own projects.


## Conclusion
Creating this social media project was a rewarding and enlightening experience. I hope others find it useful as a learning resource and as an inspiration for their own development journeys.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project.

Best regards,
